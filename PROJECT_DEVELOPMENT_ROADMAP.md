- **Query Optimization**
  - Eager loading for relationships
  - Query result caching
  - Database query monitoring
  - Slow query identification

### Caching Strategy
```php
// Multi-layer caching approach
class CacheService {
    public function getStats($tenantId) {
        return Cache::tags(['stats', "tenant:{$tenantId}"])
            ->remember("stats:{$tenantId}", 300, function() use ($tenantId) {
                return $this->calculateStats($tenantId);
            });
    }
    
    public function invalidateStats($tenantId) {
        Cache::tags(["tenant:{$tenantId}"])->flush();
    }
}
```

### Frontend Optimization
- **Asset Optimization**
  - CSS/JS minification
